# Hugging-Face

This webpage uses HTML to classify images.
It utilizes a hugging face api and a basic HTML website to function.
The user interface (UI) displays a herding "hugging face" followed by two fields: "select an image" and "file upload field."
Users may identify the species by uploading a photograph.


Google Chrome successfully renders the HTML page.
There were just two new fields added to the HTML form: an image upload field and a text field.
I included the URL of the embracing face api in the script.
and use the POST method to retrieve the data from the API with the assistance of the token authorization field, which is already created in the cuddling face here.

I use the huggin face website to call the token and the API.

YouTube is the external resource I utilized to create this HTML webpage.
To create this basic website, I watched a lot of YouTube tutorials and took inspiration for many of the ideas and suggestions presented.
